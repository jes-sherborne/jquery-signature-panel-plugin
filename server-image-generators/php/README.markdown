PHP example for SignaturePanel
====================================

This illustrates how to generate images on a server using PHP. The example code generates PNG images from signatures and stores them in the `signatures` folder on the web server.

To run the example, put the contents of the `example` directory at the root of your PHP instance and navigate to http://localhost (or however you have your instance of PHP configured).
