A jquery-based panel to capture signatures. Compatible with iPad.

* Captures all signature data (location and timing), which provides a stronger case when authenticating the signature
* performs modest input smoothing so that so that captured signature more closely matches the user's intent
* Uses spline interpolation for drawing so that signature looks realistic
